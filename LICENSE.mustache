This license lets you use this software for free, as
long as you contribute software that you make with it and share with others. Specifically:

If you follow the rules below, you may do everything with this
software that would otherwise infringe either my copyright in it,
any patent claim I can license that covers this software as of my
latest contribution, or both.

1. Contribute source code for changes you make to this software and share with others.

2. If you run or combine this software with other software in any
   larger program that you share with others, contribute all source code for that program.

3. Contribute all source code for software whose source code
   you write, change, or analyze with this software, and share with others.

4. Ensure everyone who gets a copy of this software from you,
   in source code or any other form, gets the text of this
   license and the copyright and source notices above.

5. Do not make any legal claim against anyone for infringing
   any patent claim they would infringe by using this software
   alone, accusing this software, with or without changes,
   alone or as part of a larger program.

To contribute source code, publish the preferred form for making
changes through a freely accessible distribution system widely
used for similar source code, and license contributions not
already licensed to the public on terms as permissive as this
license accordingly.

You are excused for unknowingly breaking 1, 2, or 3 if you
contribute source code, or stop doing anything requiring this
license, within 30 days of learning you broke the rule.
